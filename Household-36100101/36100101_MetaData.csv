1,"Income quintiles are assigned based on equivalized household disposable income, which takes into account differences in household size and composition using a method proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The "OECD-modified" equivalence scale assigns a value of 1 to the first adult, 0.5 to each additional person aged 14 and over, and 0.3 for all children under 14."
2,"Age groups refer to the age group of the major income earner."
3,"Housing tenure of household"
4,"Refers to the main source of income for the household, either from wages and salaries, self-employment income, net property income, current transfers received related to pension benefits, or from other current transfers received from non-pension related sources (others)."
5,"Distributions by generation are defined as follows and are based on the birth year of the major income earner : pre-1946 for those born before 1946, baby boom for those born between 1946 and 1964, generation X for those born between 1965 and 1980 and millennials for those born after 1980.  Note that generation Z has been combined with the millennial generation as their sample size is relatively small."
